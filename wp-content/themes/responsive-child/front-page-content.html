	Do you have a closet full of clothes and still nothing to wear?  Do you feel stress levels elevating as you enter your closet to pull together an outfit for a day or night out?  You may have many fabulous jeans, tops, shoes and accessories...but can you make use of what you have to pull together fabulous outfits?  The first step to closet organization is to shop in your closet (and drawers)!
</p>
<p>
	Many people find their closets to be unorganized, lacking basic essentials and lacking key accessories to pull together outfits.  Other people simply do not have the time to keep pace with the latest in fashion and the constant changing of outfits required as the seasons change.  That's why the need for wardrobe organization has never been greater. Being able to get dressed and leave your home in a timely fashion is something we can all relate to, and if we can do it with a feeling of confidence and style, even better!

	It was this very desire to increase the happiness and reduce stress levels of women that the idea of Closet Therapy was born.  The concept of an in-home service to organize the clutter while identifying how to make the most out of a client's existing wardrobe, is something Michele is very passionate about.  She understands that by spending time going through a client's closet and drawers with a fine tooth comb, they would be able to simplify pulling together a wide range of outfits and provide a cleansing of each personâ€™s wardrobe.

	Whether your style is chic, sexy, sporty, earthy, classy or somewhere in between, Closet Therapy will help you determine if your current wardrobe is sufficient, will allow you to easily view your clothes, shoes & accessories in your closet and will compartmentalize your wardrobe for the different roles you play in your life.
